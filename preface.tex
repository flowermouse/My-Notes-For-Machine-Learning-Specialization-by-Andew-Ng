    \section{What you will learn?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Build ML models with NumPy \& scikit-learn, %
        build \& train supervised models for prediction \& binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
        \item Build \& train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform %
        multi-class classification, \& build \& use decision trees \& tree ensemble methods
        \item Apply best practices for ML development \& use unsupervised learning %
        techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering \& anomaly detection
        \item Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach %
        \& a content-based deep learning method \& build a deep reinforcement learning model
    \end{itemize}

    \section{What is machine learning?}
    Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

    \subsection*{Types of machine learning}
    There are three main types of machine learning:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supervised learning
        \item Unsupervised learning
        \item Reinforcement learning
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection*{Supervised learning}
    \begin{dfnbox}{Supervised Learning}{supervised}
        \dfntxt{Supervised Learning} is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset.
    \end{dfnbox}

    \subsubsection*{Unsupervised learning}
    \begin{dfnbox}{Unsupervised Learning}{unsupervised}
        \dfntxt{Unsupervised Learning} is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset.
    \end{dfnbox}

    \subsubsection*{Reinforcement learning}
    \begin{dfnbox}{Reinforcement Learning}{reinforcement}
        \dfntxt{Reinforcement Learning} is a type of machine learning where the model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
